# KNN-from-scratch

## Description

KNN classifier algorithm practice, developed from scratch using basic built-in functions.
The notebook includes three defined functions from different distance measure methods (euclidean, cosine and chebyshev).
KNN function includes a boolean parameter to apply the weighted version.
Finally, some visualisation graphs are made to analyse features correlation and some analysis insights from the document.
